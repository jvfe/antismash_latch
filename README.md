## antiSMASH

antiSMASH allows the rapid genome-wide identification,
annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis
gene clusters in bacterial and fungal genomes.

It integrates and cross-links with a large number of in silico
secondary metabolite analysis tools that have been published earlier [^1].
